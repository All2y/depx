A fast, intelligent dependency analyzer for JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust projects. Built in Rust for performance.

## 🌟 Why depx?

Your `node_modules` contains many packages. Do you know:
- Which ones your project actually imports?
- Why certain packages are installed without any clear purpose?
- If a reported vulnerability affects any of your used code?

Standard tools like `npm ls`, `npm audit`, and `depcheck` provide disjointed data without the needed context. depx connects the dots to give you a clearer view.
